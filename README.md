## Introduction

PokeArcadia is a fun game where you get to work with a PokÃ©mon-themed project. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. You'll be adding data to the backend, and your changes will be reflected in the frontend. Along the way, you'll get hands-on experience with GitHub by learning how to make changes, push them to GitHub, and collaborate with others.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project structure:

PokeArcadia/

   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ backend/ # The backend where you will make your changes
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Entries/ # The folder where you will add your .txt files
     â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file!

     
## How to Contribute

To contribute to PokeArcadia, you'll be adding your own .txt file to the `backend/Entries/` folder. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## File Format

When you add a new `.txt` file to the `backend/Entries/` folder, make sure it follows this format:

PokeID, YourName
