## Introduction

PokeArcadia is a fun game where you get to work with a Pok√©mon-themed project. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. You'll be adding data to the backend, and your changes will be reflected in the frontend. Along the way, you'll get hands-on experience with GitHub by learning how to make changes, push them to GitHub, and collaborate with others.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project structure:

Poke/
 ‚îÇ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/ # The frontend of the game <br />
   ‚îÇ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdn/ # The folder where you will add your .txt files <br />
     ‚îÇ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # This file! <br />

     
## How to Contribute

To contribute to PokeArcadia, you'll be adding your own .txt file to the `backend/Entries/` folder. Follow the instructions below to get started.

# File Format

When you add a new `.txt` file to the `pokedc/cdn/` folder, make sure it follows this format:
<br>
your_name;<br>
enrol_no;<br>
pokemon_index;<br>
message;<br>
## Examples -><br>
akshit;<br>
21480248;<br>
24;<br>
osdc>>; <br>

This file format is used to record the Pok√©mon ID and the name of the contributor.
